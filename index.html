<p><h3> Hye Assalamualaikum. I am Siti Hazirah. Since the Covid19 has been spread rapidly in our country, the MCO or Movement Control Order has been extended. <br>
But as the days have gone by, life actually has settled down to a pleasant equilibrium. I am starting to enjoy my new life in these days. <br>
I managed to spend more time with my family here.Suffice it to say, the clouds will eventually lift.<br>
In the meantime, let's create sunshine and hapiness and find the silver lining.So, I want to share my new routines to you.</h3> <br>

<b><h2>1. Online and Distance Learner</b></h2>
<center><h3>Since we are having MCO, so we cannot make any face to face class. The only way to carry on the studies is within the <br>
online class. Yes, I admit it that I miss my friends and also my lecturers. But there is nothing that we can do right?<br>
So, the classes are being proceed. Everyday I will have online classes. And I have to do the assignments and submit them via online.</h3>

<b><h2>2. Watching Movies and Dramas</b></h2>
<center><h3>SKdramas are pretty great and there's no denying our addiction to them. We can't lie to ourselves though. The appeal<br>
of Kdramas is exponentially increased by the attractiveness of all the people in them. I love korean dramas because of their storylines <br>
that are so creative and fresh. Their stories are so dramatic and unreal but beautiful. Other than that, the actors are act greatly. <br>
In every dramas, they will shoot at nice places such as beaches, mountains, or even big cities.</h3></p></center><br>

<b><h2>3. Cooking and Baking</h2></b>
<center><h3>Making biscuits and cakes or cooking lunch and dinner are very fun for me. Therefore, I already baked some cakes during this MCO. I baked <br>
Kek Marble with my mom. I learned some new kuih also like Kuih Karipap Pusing. It has many steps to do. My mom was excited to do it and finally <br>
 we made it. We also learned some new recipes and tried them. During these MCO, I can improve my knowledges and skills in baking. <br>
Furthermore, I can spend more time with my mother when baking cakes.</h3><br>
